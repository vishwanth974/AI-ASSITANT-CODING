        "- **Adaptive Nature:** Insertion Sort is \"adaptive,\" meaning its performance improves significantly when the input array is partially or nearly sorted. When an element is already in its correct position or close to it, the inner `while` loop in Insertion Sort performs very few comparisons and shifts, leading to a near O(n) performance for almost sorted data.\n",
